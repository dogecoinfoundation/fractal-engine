## What is the Fractal Engine project?
Fractal Engine is a 'sidechain' that adds Tokenisation support to Dogecoin.

The objective: Add tokenisation support to Dogecoin without adding too much data too the Dogecoin L1 to prevent it from becoming bloated and slow.

## What are the moving parts?
Fractal Engine relies on you having access to a Dogecoin Core, DogeNet and optionally the Fractal Admin UI.

### Dogecoin Core
You can use an existing core, or run your own core. There is a container within Fractal Engine to run the Dogecoin Core or you can view the Dogecoin docs to see how you can setup your own.

### DogeNet
DogeNet is gossip network built by the Dogecoin Foundation. This allows peers to share information to one another.

### Fractal Admin UI
This is an optional user interface that ships with the Fractal Engine. It can be run standalone or embedded. This tool gives you a simple user interface to exercise the functionality of the Fractal Engine.
