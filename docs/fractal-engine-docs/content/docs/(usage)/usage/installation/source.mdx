title: Building from Source
---

We utilise [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) for our development and build process. This lets us have a unified, deterministic environment across multiple platforms.

<Callout>You only need the Nix build tooling, you do not need to be using NixOS</Callout>

### Building the Engine

Our `nix.flake` exports the `fractal-engine` package as the default derivative, so you can build with:

```sh
nix build .# -L --print-out-paths
```

This will log the absolute path to the folder containing the built output binary for `fractal-engine`.

### Building the CLI tool

<Callout>This tool should only be used for exploration, not for production usage.</Callout>

Similar to the engine itself, run:

```sh
nix build .#cli -L --print-out-paths
```

Once the CLI tool has been built, see [CLI Tool](../tools-and-libs/cli.mdx) for usage.
