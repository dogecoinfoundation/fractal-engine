title: Setting Up (Manually)
---

By default, there are a few moving parts that you need running:

- [Fractal Engine](../installation/releases.mdx)
- [A PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Dogecoin Core](https://dogecoin.com)

### Dogecoin Core

Fractal Engine requires access to a Dogecoin Core node that has been fully synced with the network.

It requires RPC be configured and available. If you want to also deploy the Fractal Admin UI for testing, ZMQ must also be configured.

### Fractal Engine

```sh
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://fractal:fractal@localhost:5432/fractal
export DOGE_HOST=localhost        # Dogecoin Core hostname
export DOGE_USER=rpcusername      # Dogecoin Core RPC username
export DOGE_PASSWORD=rpcpassword  # Dogecoin Core RPC password

/path/to/fractal-engine
```

There are many other configuration options available, see [Comprehensive Configuration](./comprehensive.mdx) for more details.
