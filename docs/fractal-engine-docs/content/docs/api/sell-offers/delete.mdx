  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    public_key: '03a1b2c3d4e5f6...',
    signature: '304502210...',
    payload: {

### Python

```python
import requests

payload = {
    "public_key": "03a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
    "signature": "304502210...",
    "payload": {
        "offer_hash": "abc123def456..."
    }
}

response = requests.post('http://localhost:8080/sell-offers/delete', json=payload)
print(response.text)  # "Sell offer deleted"
```

## Notes

- The deletion will be gossiped to other nodes in the network
- You can only delete sell offers that you created (verified by public key)
- The signature must be created by signing the JSON payload with your private key
- Once deleted, the sell offer will no longer be available for purchase
- This action cannot be undone
