```

## Response Fields

## Notes

- The sell offer will be gossiped to other nodes in the network after creation
- You must own the tokens you're offering to sell
- The signature must be created by signing the JSON payload with the private key
- Sell offers enable P2P token trading without intermediaries
- Other users can create buy offers or invoices to purchase your tokens
