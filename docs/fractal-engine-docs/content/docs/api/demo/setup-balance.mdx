## What This Endpoint Does

1. **Generates 101 blocks** to mature coinbase transactions
2. **Sends 1000 DOGE** to the specified address
3. **Generates 1 additional block** to confirm the transaction

This provides a funded address for testing token minting, trading, and other operations in a development environment.

## Use Cases

- **Development Testing**: Quick setup of funded addresses for testing
- **Integration Testing**: Automated test suite setup
- **Demo Environments**: Preparing addresses for demonstrations
- **Local Development**: Bootstrap development environment with test funds

## Notes

- Only works with regtest/development Dogecoin networks
- Creates mature coinbase outputs that can be spent immediately
- The 1000 DOGE amount is sufficient for most testing scenarios
- Use this before testing token minting, buying, or selling operations
- Not available in production environments for security reasons
